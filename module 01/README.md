### Javascript types and gotchas
* We have Convered the 6 types of javascript: boolean, number, string, object, function, and undefined
* We have seen how to use JSON to describe complex object values
* We have seen the true meaning of the `new` and `this` keywords, and most specifically - that they do not have the same meaning as in Java.
* We have experienced the problem of the missing `this` context
* We learned about javascript scopes and **Closures**
* We learned about the `prototype` object and property

### NodeJS
* We learned the difference between serverside javascript (**NodeJS**) and clientside web javascript
  * We talked about modularity and the `require` keyword
  * We talked about `webpack`  - a utility to pack "serverside" javascript files into one "web-ready" file


## Work Environment
* We saw how to turn a folder into an npm package by running `npm init`
* We saw how to use the node.js `require` command in order to incorporate another module (file) into our code
* We saw how the `package.json` file manages the project as a package.
* We saw how to install external packages using `npm install` and the `package.json > dependencies` section
* We talked about the diffrence between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` 
* We saw how to install the typescript compiler into the package
