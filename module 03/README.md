| [Hello Angular](./projects/hello-angular/) | Bare bones angular application |


### Angular from way above
* We talked again about SPA and the role of client application, UI Server and Data Server
* We explained that angular development is done in a nodeJS environment but the code is compiled to a javascript that runs in the browser
* We talked about how an angular application is served:
    - You write your code in many files
    - The files go through compilation
    - The compiled files are then packed into single `main.js` file
    - The UI Server serves an empty `index.html`
    - The html file links to the main.js which then runs in the browser

### The angular CLI
* Helps us to create new angular projects with many many files
* Helps us to generate angular "items" with initial template
* Helps us to automagically compile and pack our code - **ALL THE TIME**
* Helps us by bringing up a development web server that serves the application to the browser in 'localhost:4200'
* Can also help us to automatically test the code and build it for production
* Is installed using npm

### An angular app structure
* We have created an app using the cli
* We run it using `ng serve` and the browsing the `localhost:4200`
* We went through the configuration files
* We saw how index.html is an empty html file that links to the compiled script
* We inspected `main.ts` and saw that it "bootstraps" a main component  `AppComponent`
* We saw that `AppComponent` is a class with `Component` decorator, which turns it into an angular component
* We saw that an angular component is a new "Html Tag" with its own looks and behavior
    - The behavior is written in typescript 
    - The looks are defined in html and CSS

### The Evolution of the web into SPA
* We talked about how the web used to be a huge collection of HTML documents
* We talked about the `HTTP` protocol that is used to create short connections to server and receive response to a single request
* We talked about the `AJAX` paradigm where the client sends http requests to the server while the application continues to run, and integrates the received data into the `DOM`
* We have seen how `SPA` (Single Page Application) is the extreme case of the AJAX paradigm, where a full application is delivered as a single, empty page and a JS file with all the code to generate the UI.
* We covered how `Angular` fits into the SPA world by providing a work environment and development patterns for **clientside** single page apps

### Introduction to angular
* We used npm to intall the angular CLI
* We used the cli to generate a new angular project using `ng new --standalone`
* we have run the application using `ng serve` and viewed the application in the browser
* We went over the project structure and files, including `main.ts`, `index.html` and `styles.css`
* We have inspected the App Component and understood that
    * A plain class turns into an Angular Component using the `@Component` Decorator
* The anuglar engine inspects the DOM, and applies it's magic on elements it recognizes as components
    * Inject the template into the DOM node
    * Instantiate the component class
    * Bind the html to the component instance members

### MVVM
* We understood the evolution that lead to the `Model View View-Model` paradigm
* We learned the role of each part of the pattern
* We understood that a component is a pair of view and view model
* We saw how to create an angular application while thinking "mvvm"
* We wrote a simple search application
* We learned about the concept of **Directive** and understood that there are 2 types of them
    - Element directive - is put on an element and changes its behavior
    - Structural directive - is put on an element and can modify the structure of the HTML DOM
* We were introduced to the directives:
    - `*ngIf`
    - `*ngFor`
    - disabled
    - class.something
* We learned how to wire interactivity using angular events
    - for example `(click) = "doSomething()"`
* We learned about the concept of data binding and saw that there are 4 types of bindings
    - `{{value}}` - Text interpolation. For element content only
    - `[directive]="value"` - input binding - for directives and inputs
    - `(event)="action"` - event binding - for events
    - `*directive="whatever"` - for structural directive, each with its own syntax

### Introduction to angular binding
* We created the angular search
* We have seen how to "think MVVM" - describing the logic of our application in the view model and then writing the view and binding it to the view model.
* We have created a search application view model the performs search of a keyword
* We have seen `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` and understood what are structural directives and how they work
* We have used the `[disabled]` directive to disable the search box and button when the search is in progress
